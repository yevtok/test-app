Task:

Create applications to test password strength.

The essence of the assignment:

Create a field for entering a password, under the field add 3 sections which will show the strength of the password;

Changes in password strength must take place in real time;

How to calculate the strength of a password:

    1) Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;

    2) Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;

    3) Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;

The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:

    - If the field is empty, all sections are gray;

    - If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;

    - If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;

    - If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;

    - If the password is strong, all sections are green;
